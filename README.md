# TREZOR Community

[![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/trezor/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/trezor/community)

This repository does not hold any code.

It is just for the discussion of TREZOR Developer Community via GitHub issues.

It allows us to use familiar web interface together with email notifications and also replies via email.

This is not a support channel for TREZOR users. If you have a problem using TREZOR, contact our support at support@trezor.io

If you have an user question you might want to use [TREZOR subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR) or [TREZOR Telegram group](https://t.me/trezortalk) instead.

Also, please, read our documentation first, before asking a question, so you can be sure you understand the concept and don't ask something that has already been explained:

* [TREZOR User Manual](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/)
* [TREZOR FAQ](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/)
* [TREZOR Developer's Guide](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-tech/)
